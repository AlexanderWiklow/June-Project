            My name is Alexander Wikl√∂w, and I am a Fullstack Web Developer with
            a passion for creating innovative and user-friendly web
            applications. With a strong educational background and extensive
            hands-on experience, I am equipped with the skills and knowledge

          <p>
            Education: I pursued my education at Nackademien, where I completed
            the Webbutveckling Fullstack Open Source program. This comprehensive
            program provided me with a solid foundation in web development,
            covering both frontend and backend technologies. Additionally, I
            obtained a Bachelor's degree in Humanities, specializing in the
            Chinese language from Stockholms Universitet. During my studies, I
            had the opportunity to immerse myself in Chinese culture by
            attending South West University, Zhejiang University, and Changchun
            University.
          </p>
          <p>
            Skills: My technical skill set includes knowledge in HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, React, SQL, MySQL, NodeJS, ExpressJS, and the Microsoft
            Office suite. Additionally, my proficiency in backend technologies
            allows me to create robust and scalable web applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Work Experience: I have gained valuable work experience in various
            roles throughout my career. I worked as an Administrator at Yamaha
            Motor Sweden, where I honed my organizational and multitasking
            abilities. As an independent entrepreneur at Wiklow Trading &
            Consulting, I successfully managed my own business, demonstrating my
            strong entrepreneurial spirit and business skills. I also worked as
            a Consultant at Academic Work, where I collaborated with diverse
            clients, further enhancing my problem-solving and communication
            skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            Achievements: One of my notable achievements was receiving a
            scholarship from the Chinese government, which enabled me to live in
            China for a year and study the language and culture. This experience
            not only broadened my horizons but also deepened my understanding of
            cross-cultural communication.
